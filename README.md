# 🌍 Global Aid Coordination Network

Welcome to a decentralized platform revolutionizing humanitarian aid! This project uses the Stacks blockchain to create a transparent network where NGOs, governments, and relief organizations can log their aid commitments, avoid duplication of efforts, and ensure efficient resource allocation during crises like natural disasters or refugee situations.

## ✨ Features

🔗 Register organizations with verified credentials  
📝 Log immutable aid commitments (e.g., food supplies to a specific region)  
🚫 Detect and prevent duplicate commitments in real-time  
🔍 Query and visualize existing aid coverage by location or category  
🤝 Coordinate multi-org collaborations through shared proposals  
💰 Integrate token-based incentives for verified aid delivery  
📊 Generate reports on aid gaps and overlaps for better planning  
✅ Verify commitment fulfillment via oracle integrations  

## 🛠 How It Works

This project leverages Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain for secure, transparent coordination. Organizations interact via a web dApp or CLI tools to submit and query data. All commitments are hashed and timestamped immutably, ensuring trust without a central authority.

**For Aid Organizations**  
- Register your org with details like name, focus areas, and proof of legitimacy.  
- Create a commitment: Specify aid type (e.g., "1000 tents"), location (e.g., "Syria, Aleppo"), timeline, and quantity.  
- The system checks for overlaps; if clear, it's logged publicly.  
- Update status (e.g., "delivered") with evidence for verification rewards.  

**For Coordinators and Donors**  
- Search commitments by region or category to spot gaps (e.g., "Show unfunded medical aid in Ukraine").  
- Propose joint initiatives; orgs can vote or co-sign.  
- Verify past commitments to build trust and allocate funding wisely.  

**For Verifiers and Auditors**  
- Use query functions to fetch details on any commitment.  
- Trigger oracle-based checks for real-world fulfillment (e.g., via satellite imagery or on-ground reports).  
- Dispute suspicious entries through governance mechanisms.
